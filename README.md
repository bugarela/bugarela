### Hello :octocat:

I'm Gabriela, and I work with **programming languages** and **formal methods**.

My **main project** right now is [Quint](https://github.com/informalsystems/quint/) ✨,
a specification language based on TLA+, on which I get to work full-time as a
research engineer at [Informal Systems](https://github.com/informalsystems/) 👩‍💻.

I hold a **master's degree** 🎓, and both my [bachelor's
thesis](https://github.com/bugarela/bachelor-thesis) (Portuguese) and my
[master's thesis](https://github.com/bugarela/masters-dissertation) (English)
are about TLA+ tools, compiled in a project called [TLA
Transmutation](https://github.com/bugarela/tla-transmutation), with prototypes
that generate Elixir code and tests from TLA+ specifications. 
> PS: I have no intention
of continuing this development since Quint has a great execution environment
that meets most of the criteria I had for this project, and it's much more viable
with a team working on it.

Aside from TLA+, I have a background in **static analysis**, which constitutes most
of my daily work right now. My very first paper was in **type systems**: [Type
inference for GADTs, OutsideIn and
anti-unification](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3264637.3264644). You can check
my Haskell implementation of some type inference algorithms:
- [Hindley-Milner](https://github.com/bugarela/tipos)
- [OutsideIn](https://github.com/bugarela/OutsideIn)
- [OutsideIn with anti-unification](https://github.com/bugarela/GADTInference)

All of these are things that I'm very interested in and I continually
get to share them with my friends at the **[Função](https://github.com/funcao) Research
Group** 💜. For the first semester of 2024, I'll be teaching formal methods as a temporary 
lecturer at UDESC.

I'm Brazillian 🇧🇷, I love it here, and you can find me on our beaches from December
to February (yes, that's summer ☀️). I'm also a competitive dancer 💃, cat owner 🐈, and
casual gamer 🎮.
